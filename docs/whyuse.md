# Why use Awperative?

In an industry dominated by "triple AAA" game engines a lot of 
people question why you would bother with the little guy. Many
people don't currently consider making games outside of a
familiar three (or four), which most consider to be

- [**Unity**](https://unity.com/)
- [**Unreal Engine**](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US)
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en) (Depending on who you ask)

It undeniable that most people will start out with one of these engines
and in fact most people should! Compared to lower level game libaries such as MonoGame or Love
it is comparatively easy to make quick games and learn the basics of
programming when you are using one of the high level engines.

However, as you progress throughout your developing journey it may be more tempting and realistic to build
your projects from complete or near scratch. Such a goal is not unrealistic either. The most accomplished
low level "Game Library" is probably MonoGame. Which has a very  long and proven track record of hits.  Specifically, 
both [Stardew Valley](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/) and [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/) Personal favorites of mine.

Making your game with a library also has stark financial incentives; Large game engines tend to levy
significant bills over developers using their platform. While most libraries and specifically Awperative
are completely **free** and **open source**!
