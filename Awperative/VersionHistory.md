# Awperative V1.0!

### Made by Avery Norris! 

---

This is the very **first official** version of Awperative! Out of the box Awperative has come with the following :

* Entity Component System using Components, Scenes and Dockers!


* Dynamic Debugging System which is used in multiple modules already


* Simple Overhead Modules

Current plans are to finish some unit tests, check Awperative up and down for naming consistency,
syntax, and bugs and begin building a Game Engine on top of it.

A few modules have been given documentation and the website is currently underway.
